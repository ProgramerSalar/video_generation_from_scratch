./clip_video/Algebra Basics： Graphing On The Coordinate Plane - Math Antics [9Uc62CuQjc4]/videos/clip_0000.mp4,"Hi, I’m Rob.  Welcome to Math Antics!"
./clip_video/Algebra Basics： Graphing On The Coordinate Plane - Math Antics [9Uc62CuQjc4]/videos/clip_0001.mp4,"In this lesson, we’re gonna learn something that’s an important foundation for tons of math problems, including those you’ll encounter while learning basic Algebra."
./clip_video/Algebra Basics： Graphing On The Coordinate Plane - Math Antics [9Uc62CuQjc4]/videos/clip_0002.mp4,"We’re gonna learn about graphing, which basically means taking mathematical relationships and turning them into pictures."
./clip_video/Algebra Basics： Graphing On The Coordinate Plane - Math Antics [9Uc62CuQjc4]/videos/clip_0003.mp4,"Hey Friends, welcome back to The Joy of Graphing."
./clip_video/Algebra Basics： Graphing On The Coordinate Plane - Math Antics [9Uc62CuQjc4]/videos/clip_0004.mp4,We’re gonna pick up right where we left off.
./clip_video/Algebra Basics： Graphing On The Coordinate Plane - Math Antics [9Uc62CuQjc4]/videos/clip_0005.mp4,"We already have this nice, beautiful function right here."
./clip_video/Algebra Basics： Graphing On The Coordinate Plane - Math Antics [9Uc62CuQjc4]/videos/clip_0006.mp4,But it needs a friend.
./clip_video/Algebra Basics： Graphing On The Coordinate Plane - Math Antics [9Uc62CuQjc4]/videos/clip_0007.mp4,And we’re gonna do that by adding some points.
./clip_video/Algebra Basics： Graphing On The Coordinate Plane - Math Antics [9Uc62CuQjc4]/videos/clip_0008.mp4,So let’s put the next point right here.
./clip_video/Algebra Basics： Graphing On The Coordinate Plane - Math Antics [9Uc62CuQjc4]/videos/clip_0009.mp4,Now all we need to do is connect those points…cuz they’re all friends.
./clip_video/Algebra Basics： Graphing On The Coordinate Plane - Math Antics [9Uc62CuQjc4]/videos/clip_0010.mp4,And what to friends do?
./clip_video/Algebra Basics： Graphing On The Coordinate Plane - Math Antics [9Uc62CuQjc4]/videos/clip_0011.mp4,They stay connected.
./clip_video/Algebra Basics： Graphing On The Coordinate Plane - Math Antics [9Uc62CuQjc4]/videos/clip_0012.mp4,Oh and look at that… That’s beautiful.
./clip_video/Algebra Basics： Graphing On The Coordinate Plane - Math Antics [9Uc62CuQjc4]/videos/clip_0013.mp4,"Well, not the kind of picture that you’d hang on your wall."
./clip_video/Algebra Basics： Graphing On The Coordinate Plane - Math Antics [9Uc62CuQjc4]/videos/clip_0014.mp4,Graphing just means making a visual representation of an equation or data set so you can understand it better.
./clip_video/Algebra Basics： Graphing On The Coordinate Plane - Math Antics [9Uc62CuQjc4]/videos/clip_0015.mp4,It’s a way of helping you literally SEE how math works.
./clip_video/Algebra Basics： Graphing On The Coordinate Plane - Math Antics [9Uc62CuQjc4]/videos/clip_0016.mp4,"When math is just a bunch of numbers and symbols on a page, it can be pretty abstract and hard to relate to."
./clip_video/Algebra Basics： Graphing On The Coordinate Plane - Math Antics [9Uc62CuQjc4]/videos/clip_0017.mp4,But graphing is like a window into the abstract world of math that helps us see it more clearly.
./clip_video/Algebra Basics： Graphing On The Coordinate Plane - Math Antics [9Uc62CuQjc4]/videos/clip_0018.mp4,"In fact, the focus of our lesson today actually looks a bit like a window."
./clip_video/Algebra Basics： Graphing On The Coordinate Plane - Math Antics [9Uc62CuQjc4]/videos/clip_0019.mp4,…and it’s called “The Coordinate Plane”.
./clip_video/Algebra Basics： Graphing On The Coordinate Plane - Math Antics [9Uc62CuQjc4]/videos/clip_0020.mp4,The coordinate plane is the platform or stage that our graphing will take place on.
./clip_video/Algebra Basics： Graphing On The Coordinate Plane - Math Antics [9Uc62CuQjc4]/videos/clip_0021.mp4,"But to understand how it works, we first need to start with its closest relative; The Number Line."
./clip_video/Algebra Basics： Graphing On The Coordinate Plane - Math Antics [9Uc62CuQjc4]/videos/clip_0022.mp4,"You remember how a number line works, right?"
./clip_video/Algebra Basics： Graphing On The Coordinate Plane - Math Antics [9Uc62CuQjc4]/videos/clip_0023.mp4,"A number line starts at zero, and represents positive numbers as you move to the right and negative numbers as you more to the left."
./clip_video/Algebra Basics： Graphing On The Coordinate Plane - Math Antics [9Uc62CuQjc4]/videos/clip_0024.mp4,And there’s usually marks showing where each integer is along the way.
./clip_video/Algebra Basics： Graphing On The Coordinate Plane - Math Antics [9Uc62CuQjc4]/videos/clip_0025.mp4,Now imagine cloning that number line and rotating the copy counter-clockwise by 90 degrees so that the second number line is perpendicular to the first and they intersect at their zero points.
./clip_video/Algebra Basics： Graphing On The Coordinate Plane - Math Antics [9Uc62CuQjc4]/videos/clip_0026.mp4,"What we have now is a “number plane”.  It’s basically like a 2-Dimensional version of a number line, but that second dimension makes it much more useful."
./clip_video/Algebra Basics： Graphing On The Coordinate Plane - Math Antics [9Uc62CuQjc4]/videos/clip_0027.mp4,"With a simple 1-Dimensional number line, we could show where various numbers were located along that line by drawing (or plotting) points."
./clip_video/Algebra Basics： Graphing On The Coordinate Plane - Math Antics [9Uc62CuQjc4]/videos/clip_0028.mp4,"But no matter how many points we plot, they’re always on the same line."
./clip_video/Algebra Basics： Graphing On The Coordinate Plane - Math Antics [9Uc62CuQjc4]/videos/clip_0029.mp4,"But with a 2-Dimensional number plane, we can plot points anywhere in that 2D area, and that opens up a whole new world of possibilities."
./clip_video/Algebra Basics： Graphing On The Coordinate Plane - Math Antics [9Uc62CuQjc4]/videos/clip_0030.mp4,"With a 1-Dimensional number line, plotting points was easy."
./clip_video/Algebra Basics： Graphing On The Coordinate Plane - Math Antics [9Uc62CuQjc4]/videos/clip_0031.mp4,You just needed one number to tell you where to plot a point.
./clip_video/Algebra Basics： Graphing On The Coordinate Plane - Math Antics [9Uc62CuQjc4]/videos/clip_0032.mp4,"But with a 2-Dimensional number plane, you actually need TWO numbers to plot each point."
./clip_video/Algebra Basics： Graphing On The Coordinate Plane - Math Antics [9Uc62CuQjc4]/videos/clip_0033.mp4,These two numbers are called “coordinates” because they’re the same ‘rank’ or ‘order’ and they work together to specify the locations of a point on the number plane.
./clip_video/Algebra Basics： Graphing On The Coordinate Plane - Math Antics [9Uc62CuQjc4]/videos/clip_0034.mp4,"In fact, that’s why the number plane is often referred to as the “coordinate plane”."
./clip_video/Algebra Basics： Graphing On The Coordinate Plane - Math Antics [9Uc62CuQjc4]/videos/clip_0035.mp4,It’s the stage for plotting coordinates.
./clip_video/Algebra Basics： Graphing On The Coordinate Plane - Math Antics [9Uc62CuQjc4]/videos/clip_0036.mp4,Coordinates use a special format to help you recognize them.
./clip_video/Algebra Basics： Graphing On The Coordinate Plane - Math Antics [9Uc62CuQjc4]/videos/clip_0037.mp4,The two numbers are put inside parentheses with a comma between them as a separator.
./clip_video/Algebra Basics： Graphing On The Coordinate Plane - Math Antics [9Uc62CuQjc4]/videos/clip_0038.mp4,So when you see 2 comma 5 or negative 7 comma 3 or 0 comma 1.5 you know you’re dealing with coordinates.
./clip_video/Algebra Basics： Graphing On The Coordinate Plane - Math Antics [9Uc62CuQjc4]/videos/clip_0039.mp4,"Okay, to understand how coordinates work, remember that our number plane is formed by combining two perpendicular number lines."
./clip_video/Algebra Basics： Graphing On The Coordinate Plane - Math Antics [9Uc62CuQjc4]/videos/clip_0040.mp4,"From now on, we’re going to refer to each one of these number lines as an “axis”."
./clip_video/Algebra Basics： Graphing On The Coordinate Plane - Math Antics [9Uc62CuQjc4]/videos/clip_0041.mp4,One of the axes is horizontal (like the horizon) which means the other axis is vertical (or straight up and down).
./clip_video/Algebra Basics： Graphing On The Coordinate Plane - Math Antics [9Uc62CuQjc4]/videos/clip_0042.mp4,And they’re often called the “horizontal” and “vertical” axes because of that.
./clip_video/Algebra Basics： Graphing On The Coordinate Plane - Math Antics [9Uc62CuQjc4]/videos/clip_0043.mp4,"But even more often, the axes are referred to by variable-based names."
./clip_video/Algebra Basics： Graphing On The Coordinate Plane - Math Antics [9Uc62CuQjc4]/videos/clip_0044.mp4,The horizontal axis is called “the X-axis” and the vertical axis is called “the Y-Axis”.
./clip_video/Algebra Basics： Graphing On The Coordinate Plane - Math Antics [9Uc62CuQjc4]/videos/clip_0045.mp4,Why use variable names?
./clip_video/Algebra Basics： Graphing On The Coordinate Plane - Math Antics [9Uc62CuQjc4]/videos/clip_0046.mp4,Well there’s two good reasons.
./clip_video/Algebra Basics： Graphing On The Coordinate Plane - Math Antics [9Uc62CuQjc4]/videos/clip_0047.mp4,"The first is that variable names are more flexible than horizontal and vertical, which relate to a specific orientation in space that may not always be relevant."
./clip_video/Algebra Basics： Graphing On The Coordinate Plane - Math Antics [9Uc62CuQjc4]/videos/clip_0048.mp4,And the second reason is that each of the two coordinate numbers is actually a variable that relates to a specific position along one of the two axes of the coordinate plane.
./clip_video/Algebra Basics： Graphing On The Coordinate Plane - Math Antics [9Uc62CuQjc4]/videos/clip_0049.mp4,"And since those variables are usually called ‘X’ and ‘Y’, it makes sense to name the two axes the same way."
./clip_video/Algebra Basics： Graphing On The Coordinate Plane - Math Antics [9Uc62CuQjc4]/videos/clip_0050.mp4,The first coordinate number listed will be called ‘X’ and the second coordinate number listed will be called ‘Y’.
./clip_video/Algebra Basics： Graphing On The Coordinate Plane - Math Antics [9Uc62CuQjc4]/videos/clip_0051.mp4,"And we’re always going to list the numbers in that same order, ’X’ first and then ‘Y’, so that we never get confused about which is which."
./clip_video/Algebra Basics： Graphing On The Coordinate Plane - Math Antics [9Uc62CuQjc4]/videos/clip_0052.mp4,"In fact, coordinates are often called “ordered pairs” because they’re a pair of numbers that are always listed in the same order: ‘X’ value first… ‘Y’ value second."
./clip_video/Algebra Basics： Graphing On The Coordinate Plane - Math Antics [9Uc62CuQjc4]/videos/clip_0053.mp4,"So if you have the coordinates, (3, 5) that means X = 3 and Y = 5."
./clip_video/Algebra Basics： Graphing On The Coordinate Plane - Math Antics [9Uc62CuQjc4]/videos/clip_0054.mp4,"Pretty easy, right?"
./clip_video/Algebra Basics： Graphing On The Coordinate Plane - Math Antics [9Uc62CuQjc4]/videos/clip_0055.mp4,But now how do we actually plot these coordinates (or ordered pairs) on the coordinate plane?
./clip_video/Algebra Basics： Graphing On The Coordinate Plane - Math Antics [9Uc62CuQjc4]/videos/clip_0056.mp4,"Well, the first number in the ordered pair tells you where along the X-Axis the point is located, and the second number in the ordered pair tells you where along the Y-Axis the point is located."
./clip_video/Algebra Basics： Graphing On The Coordinate Plane - Math Antics [9Uc62CuQjc4]/videos/clip_0057.mp4,"The two numbers in an ordered pair work together to define a single point, and each one of the numbers only gives you half of the information about where that point is."
./clip_video/Algebra Basics： Graphing On The Coordinate Plane - Math Antics [9Uc62CuQjc4]/videos/clip_0058.mp4,"To see how this works, let’s plot the coordinates (3, 2) First, we locate the X value along the X-axis, which is at 3 in this case."
./clip_video/Algebra Basics： Graphing On The Coordinate Plane - Math Antics [9Uc62CuQjc4]/videos/clip_0059.mp4,"But instead of putting a point there, we draw (or just imagine) a line perpendicular to the X-axis that goes through the 3."
./clip_video/Algebra Basics： Graphing On The Coordinate Plane - Math Antics [9Uc62CuQjc4]/videos/clip_0060.mp4,"We do that because the first number in the ordered pair only tells us where along the X-axis the point is, but it could be ANYWHERE along the Y-axis."
./clip_video/Algebra Basics： Graphing On The Coordinate Plane - Math Antics [9Uc62CuQjc4]/videos/clip_0061.mp4,We won’t know that until we plot the second number.
./clip_video/Algebra Basics： Graphing On The Coordinate Plane - Math Antics [9Uc62CuQjc4]/videos/clip_0062.mp4,"So temporarily, we just draw a line there to represent every possible point that could have an X value of 3."
./clip_video/Algebra Basics： Graphing On The Coordinate Plane - Math Antics [9Uc62CuQjc4]/videos/clip_0063.mp4,"Next, we locate the Y value along the Y-axis, which is at 2 in this case."
./clip_video/Algebra Basics： Graphing On The Coordinate Plane - Math Antics [9Uc62CuQjc4]/videos/clip_0064.mp4,"But again, instead of putting a point there, we draw (or just imagine) a line perpendicular to the Y-axis that goes through the 2."
./clip_video/Algebra Basics： Graphing On The Coordinate Plane - Math Antics [9Uc62CuQjc4]/videos/clip_0065.mp4,"We do that because the second number in the ordered pair only tells us where along the Y-axis the point is, but it could be ANYWHERE along the X-axis."
./clip_video/Algebra Basics： Graphing On The Coordinate Plane - Math Antics [9Uc62CuQjc4]/videos/clip_0066.mp4,"So we just draw a line there to represent every possible point that could have a Y value of ‘2’ Ah, but look what we’ve got now."
./clip_video/Algebra Basics： Graphing On The Coordinate Plane - Math Antics [9Uc62CuQjc4]/videos/clip_0067.mp4,The first line represents all the possible locations where X equals 3.
./clip_video/Algebra Basics： Graphing On The Coordinate Plane - Math Antics [9Uc62CuQjc4]/videos/clip_0068.mp4,And the second line represents all the possible locations where Y equals 2.
./clip_video/Algebra Basics： Graphing On The Coordinate Plane - Math Antics [9Uc62CuQjc4]/videos/clip_0069.mp4,And the exact point where the two lines intersect represents the only point in the entire coordinate plane where both X = 3 and Y = 2.
./clip_video/Algebra Basics： Graphing On The Coordinate Plane - Math Antics [9Uc62CuQjc4]/videos/clip_0070.mp4,That intersections is the location of our point.
./clip_video/Algebra Basics： Graphing On The Coordinate Plane - Math Antics [9Uc62CuQjc4]/videos/clip_0071.mp4,"Pretty cool, huh?  And that’s a really good way to understand how the coordinate plane works."
./clip_video/Algebra Basics： Graphing On The Coordinate Plane - Math Antics [9Uc62CuQjc4]/videos/clip_0072.mp4,But I want to show you an even easier (and more intuitive) way to actually plot points.
./clip_video/Algebra Basics： Graphing On The Coordinate Plane - Math Antics [9Uc62CuQjc4]/videos/clip_0073.mp4,This more intuitive way involves starting with a point at the origin of the coordinate plane and then treating the coordinates like a set of simple instructions that tell you how far to move your point in the X and Y directions.
./clip_video/Algebra Basics： Graphing On The Coordinate Plane - Math Antics [9Uc62CuQjc4]/videos/clip_0074.mp4,"For example, to plot the coordinates (3, 2) like before, we start by imagining a point at the origin (0, 0) Then, we look at the first number in our ordered pair to see how far we need to move our point in the X direction."
./clip_video/Algebra Basics： Graphing On The Coordinate Plane - Math Antics [9Uc62CuQjc4]/videos/clip_0075.mp4,"Since X is positive 3, we move our point a distance of 3 units in the positive X direction."
./clip_video/Algebra Basics： Graphing On The Coordinate Plane - Math Antics [9Uc62CuQjc4]/videos/clip_0076.mp4,"And then from there, since Y is positive 2, we move our point a distance of 2 units in the positive Y direction."
./clip_video/Algebra Basics： Graphing On The Coordinate Plane - Math Antics [9Uc62CuQjc4]/videos/clip_0077.mp4,So that’s a pretty easy method for plotting points!
./clip_video/Algebra Basics： Graphing On The Coordinate Plane - Math Antics [9Uc62CuQjc4]/videos/clip_0078.mp4,Let’s try it a few more times so you get the idea.
./clip_video/Algebra Basics： Graphing On The Coordinate Plane - Math Antics [9Uc62CuQjc4]/videos/clip_0079.mp4,"Let’s plot the coordinates (-4, 3)."
./clip_video/Algebra Basics： Graphing On The Coordinate Plane - Math Antics [9Uc62CuQjc4]/videos/clip_0080.mp4,"Again, we start by imagining a point at the origin and then let the coordinates tell us how far to move it along the X and Y axes."
./clip_video/Algebra Basics： Graphing On The Coordinate Plane - Math Antics [9Uc62CuQjc4]/videos/clip_0081.mp4,"Since X is negative 4, we move the point a distance of 4 units, but this time in the negative X direction which is to the left."
./clip_video/Algebra Basics： Graphing On The Coordinate Plane - Math Antics [9Uc62CuQjc4]/videos/clip_0082.mp4,"And then, since Y is positive 3, we move the point a distance of 3 units in the positive Y direction."
./clip_video/Algebra Basics： Graphing On The Coordinate Plane - Math Antics [9Uc62CuQjc4]/videos/clip_0083.mp4,"Now let’s plot the coordinates (-3, -3)."
./clip_video/Algebra Basics： Graphing On The Coordinate Plane - Math Antics [9Uc62CuQjc4]/videos/clip_0084.mp4,"In this case, X and Y are both negative, so starting with a point at  (0, 0) we move it 3 units in the negative X direction, and then 3 units in the negative Y direction."
./clip_video/Algebra Basics： Graphing On The Coordinate Plane - Math Antics [9Uc62CuQjc4]/videos/clip_0085.mp4,"And last, let’s plot the coordinates (4, -2.5)."
./clip_video/Algebra Basics： Graphing On The Coordinate Plane - Math Antics [9Uc62CuQjc4]/videos/clip_0086.mp4,"Starting at (0, 0) we move the point 4 units in the positive X direction and then 2 and 1/2 units in the negative Y direction."
./clip_video/Algebra Basics： Graphing On The Coordinate Plane - Math Antics [9Uc62CuQjc4]/videos/clip_0087.mp4,"Okay, so we’ve plotted four ordered pairs the easy way, and did you notice that each of these points is located in a different region of the coordinate place."
./clip_video/Algebra Basics： Graphing On The Coordinate Plane - Math Antics [9Uc62CuQjc4]/videos/clip_0088.mp4,These four regions are called “Quadrants” and their boundaries are defined by the two axes of the coordinate plane.
./clip_video/Algebra Basics： Graphing On The Coordinate Plane - Math Antics [9Uc62CuQjc4]/videos/clip_0089.mp4,The quadrants are named 1 through 4 so we can easily refer to them in conversations if we need to.
./clip_video/Algebra Basics： Graphing On The Coordinate Plane - Math Antics [9Uc62CuQjc4]/videos/clip_0090.mp4,"Quadrant 1 is the upper right quadrant, and it contains all of the points where both the X and Y values are positive."
./clip_video/Algebra Basics： Graphing On The Coordinate Plane - Math Antics [9Uc62CuQjc4]/videos/clip_0091.mp4,"Quadrant 2 is the upper left, and it contains all of the points that have a negative X value and a positive Y value."
./clip_video/Algebra Basics： Graphing On The Coordinate Plane - Math Antics [9Uc62CuQjc4]/videos/clip_0092.mp4,"Quadrant 3 is the lower left, and it contains all of the points that have both a negative X and a negative Y value."
./clip_video/Algebra Basics： Graphing On The Coordinate Plane - Math Antics [9Uc62CuQjc4]/videos/clip_0093.mp4,"And Quadrant 4 is the lower right, and it contains all of the points that have a positive X value and a negative Y value."
./clip_video/Algebra Basics： Graphing On The Coordinate Plane - Math Antics [9Uc62CuQjc4]/videos/clip_0094.mp4,"Roman Numerals are usually used to label the four quadrants and they’re in that order because that’s the order you would encounter the quadrants if you started with a line segment from the origin to the coordinate (1,0)"
./clip_video/Algebra Basics： Graphing On The Coordinate Plane - Math Antics [9Uc62CuQjc4]/videos/clip_0095.mp4,and then rotated that line counter-clockwise around the origin.
./clip_video/Algebra Basics： Graphing On The Coordinate Plane - Math Antics [9Uc62CuQjc4]/videos/clip_0096.mp4,Doing this sweeps out a shape called a “unit circle” which is divided into four quadrants just like the coordinate plane.
./clip_video/Algebra Basics： Graphing On The Coordinate Plane - Math Antics [9Uc62CuQjc4]/videos/clip_0097.mp4,"Alright, so now you know what the coordinate plane is, and you know how to plot points on it."
./clip_video/Algebra Basics： Graphing On The Coordinate Plane - Math Antics [9Uc62CuQjc4]/videos/clip_0098.mp4,"But you might be wondering, “What has this got to do with basic Algebra?” Well, Algebra involves many different types of equations and functions that are a lot easier to understand if we graph their solutions on the coordinate plane."
./clip_video/Algebra Basics： Graphing On The Coordinate Plane - Math Antics [9Uc62CuQjc4]/videos/clip_0099.mp4,"And as you know, the way to really get good at math is to practice what you’ve learned by doing some exercise problems."
./clip_video/Algebra Basics： Graphing On The Coordinate Plane - Math Antics [9Uc62CuQjc4]/videos/clip_0100.mp4,"Thanks for watching Math Antics, and I’ll see ya next time."
./clip_video/Algebra Basics： Graphing On The Coordinate Plane - Math Antics [9Uc62CuQjc4]/videos/clip_0101.mp4,Ohh… ohhhh… [snickering] [sarcastically]  Ah… exactly what I wanted.
